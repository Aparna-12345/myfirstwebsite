    		<h4> What are the prime causes of plastic waste?</h4><br>
    		  <div class="hel1">
Plastic is cheap, readily available, and its use is widespread.
Since plastic is an affordable and durable material, it can be found in everything from packaging materials to plastic bottles, straws to plastic bags, and much more.Until businesses start to utilise more environmentally-friendly, alternative materials (such as paper), the cycle of producing and disposing of plastic will continue. The world’s population is growing — and so is urbanisation.
Put simply, the more of us there are in the world, the greater the demand for cheap materials and in turn, the more plastic we use to excess.

To illustrate this, in the first decade of this century, more plastic has been produced than ever due to rapid urbanisation and, in turn, demand.
We have a disposable mentality when it comes to plastic
Plastic items typically have a very short lifespan — think carrier bags, water bottles, straws, and food containers. And because they’re so cheap to make, we don’t value them enough to hang on to individual items.Not only that, but the disposal of plastic is often mismanaged — so again, it ends up in landfills.

 
As new plastic items are manufactured every day, the cycle repeats.
 Marine shipping and fishing industries
The shipping and fishing industries are also responsible for contributing towards plastic waste and pollution, particularly in our oceans.

Plastic waste is often washed to shores from ships and nets used for fishing, which — you guessed it — are usually made from plastic.
<br>
Not only does this plastic pollute the water, but marine animals can become trapped in nets and/or swallow the toxic particles.

Overall, the shipping and fishing industries have a lot to answer for when it comes to plastic pollution. Some of the different types of plastic to be aware of<br>
Bioplastics:
Bioplastics — sounds good, right?<br>

Especially when most plastics come from fossil fuels. Bioplastics, on the other hand, may come from plant-based sources, such as flaxseeds — and companies are often eager to use this as a selling point.

Bioplastic or not, it’s still wise to cut down on our plastic consumption wherever possible. Bioplastics also can’t be recycled — nor can they be composted.<br>

Compostable plastics:
Compostable plastic is very similar to biodegradable plastic, except to achieve ‘compostable’ status, it must be monitored and verified by an independent third party organisation.<br>
However, being virtually the same as biodegradable plastic, compostable plastic still poses the same challenges when it ends up in our oceans. Nearly all organic waste treatment facilities can’t treat this material and will take it out as a residue sent for incineration or landfill.<br>

The above three types of plastic all emphasise that the best way to reduce plastic waste and pollution is to simply cut down. More specifically, we should be focusing on eliminating the use of single use, unrecyclable, and not recycled plastic (think takeaway  cups, polystyrene food trays like ‘clam shell’ boxes and carrier bags).<br>

Biodegradable plastics:
Biodegradable plastics (plastics that can be broken down into carbon dioxide, water, and minerals through natural processes) are another seemingly appealing alternative.

To use the term ‘biodegradable’, products must conform to national or international standards. In Europe, for example, for a plastic product to be deemed biodegradable it must:

<br>Not contain high levels of heavy metals
90% of the plastic must break down into CO2 within six months of being exposed to natural processes (including sunlight and hydrolysis)
12 weeks after exposure, 90% of the plastic leftover must be able to pass through a mesh measuring 2 x 2 mm
.The final material must not prove toxic to plants
<p>Despite this, the speed of degradation depends heavily on the type of plastic and the environment it’s in. It often does not degrade properly, as highlighted in this article.

Bioplastics don’t solve the problem of plastic in the ocean, or prevent harmful microplastics from being produced.

Once in the ocean, UV radiation and wave action helps to break down plastic. However, once the plastic is submerged in deep water, where it can become covered in biofilm or buried in sediment , the speed at which the plastic can break down falls significantly.</li>


<h3>What are the benefits of reducing plastic waste?</h3>

Reducing our plastic waste boasts numerous benefits, not the least of which include preserving natural resources, protecting the environment, and saving us money.

The benefits of reducing plastic consumption include:

Preventing pollution by lessening the amount of new raw materials used
Saves energy
Reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute towards climate change
Reduces the amount of waste that needs to be recycled or, in developing countries, sent to landfills/incinerators
Saves money, since reusable items work out cheaper than constantly purchasing more plastic.</p>
